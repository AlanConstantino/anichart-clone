                        The series centers on Makoto Shiranui, a boy who travels to Tokyo seeking to become the
                        apprentice of Mamoru Hoshisato, a world-famous magician and friend of his parents. Ever since he
                        had watched a show by Mamoru and his wife Maive, he had dreamed of being a magician. Their
                        daughter Kana (nicknamed Hatena) has been Makoto's friend since childhood. Even though Tokyo has
                        had a rash of burglaries by a beautiful woman thief, Makoto can rest easy as long as Hatena is
                        there. When he arrives at the Hoshisato residence, a haunted mansion, the family butler Jeeves
                        and the maid Emma greet him, and he is reunited with Hatena, only to find out that they don't
                        really get along now.
